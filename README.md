Santa save the dolphins!

You play as santa, and have been tasked with helping some dolphins!

Global pollution has made it hard for them to hunt for fish, and 2 of them have got trapped in the shallows, and are
too weak to swim back to the ocean!

Using the up/down/left/right arrows, guide santa around the map in search of the dolphins.

The radar in the top left will show you when you are near.

Be careful of the sea, it's freezing cold!

Be careful of the penguins! They are greedy, and will steal your fish!

Be careful of your footsteps, if the penguins see them they'll get you! Sometimes you have to wait for the snow to get heavy
so your footsteps don't last as long.

When the dolphin radar is full, hold out a fish using spacebar. Be sure to hold it over the water!

If you hold out a fish in the right place for long enough, a dolphin should come and eat it!

Good luck santa!
